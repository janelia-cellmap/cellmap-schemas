    This attribute is used by N5-fluent tools like Neuroglancer to convey the
    spacing between points on a N-dimensional coordinate grid, and the unit of measure
    for the coordinate grid, for data stored in the N5 format.
    Conventionally, it is used to express the resolution and unit of measure for the axes of
    an image.

     - If this metadata is stored in the `attributes.json` file of an N5 dataset,
    then the visualization tool Neuroglancer can use this metadata to infer coordinates
    for the data in the array.

    - If this metadata is stored in the `attributes.json` file
    of an N5 group that contains a collection of N5 datasets, then Neuroglancer will use
    this metadata to infer coordinates for that collection of datasets, assuming that
    they represent a multiscale pyramid, and provided that other required metadata is present (see [`GroupMetadata`][cellmap_schemas.multiscale.neuroglancer_n5.GroupMetadata]).

    See the Neuroglancer [N5-specific documentation](https://github.com/google/neuroglancer/tree/master/src/neuroglancer/datasource/n5)
    for details.

    Indexing note:

    The `pixelResolution.dimensions` attribute maps on to the dimensions of the array described by this
    metadata in *colexicographic* order, i.e., the first array index corresponds to the
    smallest stride of the stored representation of the array, and subsequent array
    indices are ordered by increasing stride size. This is the array indexing order used
    by Neuroglancer, and by the N5 ecosystem of tools.

    Be advised that Numpy uses *lexicographic* order for array indexing -- the first
    array index in Numpy corresponds to the largest stride of the stored representation
    of the array, and subsequent array indices are ordered by decreasing stride size.
    So Numpy users must reverse the order of the `dimensions` attribute when
    mapping it to the axes of a Numpy-like array.

    See the external [documentation](https://github.com/saalfeldlab/n5-viewer#readme) for this metadata for more information.

    Attributes
    ----------

    dimensions: Sequence[float]
            The distance, in units given by the `unit` attribute, between samples, per axis.
            Conventionally referred to as the "resolution" of the image.
    unit: str
            The physical unit for the `dimensions` attribute.

class GroupMetadata(BaseModel):
    """
    Metadata to enable displaying an N5 group containing several datasets
    as a multiresolution image in neuroglancer, based on
    [this comment](https://github.com/google/neuroglancer/issues/176#issuecomment-553027775).

    Indexing note:

    The attributes `axes`, `units`, and the elements of `scales` should be indexed
    colexicographically, i.e. the opposite order from Numpy-standard order,
    which is lexicographic.

    Attributes
    ----------
    axes : Sequence[str]
            The names of the axes of the data
    units : Sequence[str]
            The units for the axes of the data
    scales : Sequence[Sequence[PositiveInt]]
            The relative scales of each axis. E.g., if this metadata describes a 3D dataset
            that was downsampled isotropically by 2 along each axis over two iterations,
            resulting in 3 total arrays, then `scales` would be the list
            `[[1,1,1], [2,2,2], [4,4,4]]`.
    pixelResolution: PixelResolution
            An instance of `PixelResolution` that specifies the interval, in physical units,
            between adjacent samples, per axis. Note that `PixelResolution` also defines a
            `unit` attribute, which is redundant with the `units` attribute defined on this
            class.
